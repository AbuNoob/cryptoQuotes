#### Available intervals

The available intervals depends on the exchange that you use, as your `source` of market data. It is, for example, only possible to get monthly data from `binance`. To get an overview of the available intervals, the `cryptoQuotes::availableIntervals`-function can be used. It takes two arguments, `source` and `futures`.

> **Note:** The same intervals are not necessarily
> equal across markets on the same exchange

```{r}
cryptoQuotes::availableIntervals(
  source = 'kucoin',
  futures = TRUE
)
```

```{r}
cryptoQuotes::availableIntervals(
  source = 'kucoin',
  futures = FALSE
)
```

The available intervals are directly passed as `character` using the`interval` argument, in the `cryptoQuotes::getQuote`-function.
