```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(cryptoQuotes)
```

The currently supported exchanges can be viewed using the `cryptoQuotes::availableExchanges`-function. It has no `arguments` and are updated as more exchanges are added to the package.

```{r}
cryptoQuotes::availableExchanges()
```
